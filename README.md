Final project for IBM Data Science course: Web scraping using Python to collect data from online sources.

This repository hosts my final project for the IBM Data Science course, in which I apply web scraping techniques to gather data from online sources. I used Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract valuable information from selected websites. The project demonstrates my ability to effectively collect data and process it for further analysis.

Project Status: Completed
